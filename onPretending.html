								<p>Hi Friend,</p>
								<p align="justify">A few days ago I went to meet a friend in the park for some physically distant slacklining. He’s something of a new addition to my life, so I wanted things to go well. I ended up being a little late, but it was about an hour trek to the park where he was setting up his slackline, above 30 degrees celsius outside and it was a relatively last-minute plan, so I didn’t feel too bad about it. However, as I got there, I could feel myself getting dizzy, nauseous and a little weak. I tried to play it off as a joke, blame it on the heat and pretend I was ok, but between my being a terrible liar and his uncanny (and occasionally annoyingly good) ability to read me, he soon had me figured out. As most people usually are, he was incredibly sweet about it - he even offered me some of his water when we found out the water fountain was out of order - but I felt terrible. I felt so useless and small. </p>
								<p align="justify"> In my past life, I could push through just about anything. If I was feeling tired, sad, stressed, in pain or off in any way, I could hide it. I never had to worry about ruining the time I was spending with someone, detracting from their experience. But now, I can’t always just push through, and that means that plans sometimes need to be modified or cancelled. It means that the people I’m with may not get to enjoy an activity as much as they may have otherwise. I don’t mean to make it sound like my presence or happiness is necessary for others to have fun - it certainly isn’t - but I see the look in people’s eyes when I’m not feeling well. The concern and the disappointment, the regular side glances to make sure I’m still ok and the consistent efforts they make to accommodate me. And to me, that’s one of the worst feelings in the world. </p>
								<p>Sporadically yours, </p>
								<p>-E</p>
