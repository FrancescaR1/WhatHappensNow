								<p>Hi Friend,</p>
								<p align="justify"> Sleeping has been a bit of an issue lately. It used to be that I could recover from a bad night’s sleep or two in a few days, but now it’s a lot harder. Gone are the days when I could just force myself out of bed, exhausted and regretting every life decision that had brought me to that moment, because now the dizzies hit and as hard as I try, I can’t help but fall back asleep as I lay in bed waiting to feel good enough to move. Seriously, you try laying in bed with your eyes closed when you’re exhausted, try not to fall asleep and let me know how that goes. I just end up in this vicious cycle where I can’t sleep because I slept during the day and then sleep during the day because I can’t get up and I’m exhausted from being up all night. </p>
								<p align="justify"> I almost feel silly writing this, to be completely honest with you. I know that it would be almost impossible for me to force myself up when I’m that dizzy or to force myself to stay awake when the only way to keep the walls from spinning is to keep my eyes closed - in fact, I tried that a few times, one of which ended with my head narrowly missing the wall as I crashed down bringing my tower fan with me (I could swear it hasn’t forgiven me to this day). It wasn’t pretty. But even if I know all that, I still feel like it’s my fault. That I’m somehow lazy or weak. I feel like I should be able to push through it, to sit up even if the walls are spinning out of control, to keep myself awake despite the crushing fatigue and the whole being in bed thing, to force myself to fall asleep when bedtime rolls around. It’s like my brain can’t comprehend that sleeping in on days when I feel lousy is different from lazy Sunday morning sleeping in - and believe you me I’m no stranger to the intentionally lazy morning. The upside to all that is that it makes those wonderful wonderful mornings of self-indulgent relaxation so much sweeter because I finally get to not feel like I’m stuck in bed, I’m staying there because I want to be there. And trust me friend, you’ve never really appreciated the luxury of staying in bed for fun until you’ve been stuck sleeping in when you want nothing more than to be out and active! </p>
								<p align="justify"> In the end, most nights I end up laying in bed feeling terrible about myself and making plans for all the things I’m going to do the next day to break the cycle, all while knowing full well I probably won’t be able to go through with any of them because my body just won’t let me. That’s one of the hardest things about being chronically ill for me, that constant feeling that despite everything I know and all the logical counter arguments in the world, it’s somehow my fault. The feeling that all this is happening because I’m not pushing myself hard enough, because I’m not strong willed enough, not resilient enough, that I’m lazy or simply weak. That, and the knowledge that tomorrow, even though I know I probably won’t be able to push through the dizziness and fatigue, I will still try to push through it, that I will inevitably fail and that when I eventually admit defeat, I will have accomplished nothing other than making myself even more exhausted than I already was. And so the cycle will begin again.  </p>
								<p>Sporadically yours, </p>
