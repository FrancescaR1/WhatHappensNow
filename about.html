								<p>Hi Friend,</p>
								<p align="justify">Welcome! I’m glad you’re here and I hope you get some enjoyment from reading what I hope will be my reasonably regularly posted words. I don’t suppose you necessarily need to read this part to enjoy any particular entry but if you’re curious, here is some background information you might find informative. </p>
								<p align="justify"> Once upon a time, in what feels like a completely different life, I was your typical high achieving, high strung, does all the things and loves the chaos of being perpetually busy teen/young adult. That all changed about 5 years ago, when I started my undergraduate degree, I got sick. I was dizzy all the time, felt like I’d been run over by a truck more days than not and couldn’t focus on anything no matter how hard I tried. I was missing class on a regular basis for the first time in my life (it turns out it’s hard to walk to class when you’re too dizzy to stand up) and had no idea what was going on. Cue the first of many visits to the doctor, who told me it was Labirynthitis and I’d be fine in 6-8 weeks. Two months, four finals and a few weeks of Christmas vacation later, I was, in fact, not fine. </p>
								<p align="justify">Fast forward about a year and a half and I had a diagnosis: Meniere’s Disease (which I will abbreviate to MD from now on because it’s a nightmare to type and I hate seeing the name). The doctor hastily explained that there’s no cure, that the best I could do was try this medication and a low sodium diet. Tough luck that my case is pretty severe and affects my life on a daily basis, that’s all he can tell me and we’re out of time so would I kindly follow the nurse out, thank you and have a lovely day. He was probably slightly more tactful than that, but believe me when I say it wasn’t by much. So here I was, a control freak being told I no longer had control over my body. As you can imagine, I took it extremely well … that is if by well you mean not well at all. MD presents differently in different people, for me it means I’m dizzy every day, to varying degrees but mostly worse in the morning, and more severe attacks can last from a few hours to a few weeks. A lot of people have hearing loss at some point, I feel lucky that I’m not at that point yet. So here I am, 5 years later, trying to reckon with what my life will be like going forward and finally accepting that I can’t push through a chronic illness by sheer stubbornness alone.</p>
								<p align="justify">It’s hard to be a high performing student when you miss class on a regular basis and it’s a lot harder to commit to activities when you never know when your body will quit on you and you won’t be able to be where you need to be when you need to be there. I worry about getting into graduate school and about what kind of job I might be able to hold if I don’t when I know that my body will never allow me to show up 5 days a week at 9 am no matter how hard I try and I wonder who I am now that I’ve lost so many of the things that were a part of my identity for most of my life until now. Between all that, learning a whole new language centred around chronic illness and disability and still being as type A and fond of planning as I always was, I’m left wondering: “what happens now?”. So if any of that seems interesting or relatable to you, I hope you stick around. </p>
								<p>Sporadically yours,</p>
								<p>-E</p>
								<p align="justify"> P.S. I realize that the word disability holds a lot of meaning to a lot of people and I’m just starting to learn about it myself. I’m not sure that I would use it to describe my condition, but hearing from people with invisible disabilities has been incredibly helpful and insightful. </p>
