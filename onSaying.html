								<p>Hi Friend,</p>
								<p align="justify"> I had one of those moments today when you realize how you feel about something right as you’re saying the words out loud to someone else. I was chatting with a friend who has been feeling like her body is letting her down - don’t worry about her though, it’s not anything that will be lasting or negatively impact her health - and I tried to share some of the knowledge I jokingly refer to as “wisdom” that I have acquired in the last few years. She told me that she was having a hard time hearing about other people for whom things were going smoother and asked if I had ever felt that way. Of course I do, I feel that way all the time. But in response to her asking for more details, I heard myself say “I always feel that way. Anytime I hear a friend making plans for the future that don’t have a back door through which to reschedule or cancel, anytime people talk about booking early flights, anytime they talk about applying to elite universities for their graduate studies or tell me about their lives as PhD students at their top tier school, it hurts. I feel that way any time anytime someone takes a reliable and functional body for granted”. </p>
								<p align="justify"> And friend, it’s all true. Somewhere deep down I knew that, of course, but I had never realized how much those things hurt me and certainly never allowed myself to feel the hurt, the sadness, the jealousy or the frustration. I love that the people around me tell me about their lives and their plans. I adore hearing about people’s plans - bonus points if I get to help with the planning - and I would never want for anyone to avoid telling me any of that just because it hurts me. Nevertheless, in those moments I’m keenly aware that I used to be able to make those plans, to count on my body, to aspire to go to one of those top tier institutions, to feel confident about my future and to not worry that at any moment, my physical or mental health will put me out of commission for an unknown amount of time. I’m aware that I used to be that person, but mostly that I’m not that person anymore. </p>
								<p align="justify"> I’m generally a big proponent of just getting on with things. Partly I’ve tried the wallowing thing and come to the conclusion that it’s neither helpful nor productive, but it’s also just who I am and who I always have been. For the most part, I think that my “get straight up, dust yourself off and and move right along” attitude to life has served me well, but more and more I’ve started to see the value in taking a moment to acknowledge what you’re feeling and to feel those things before putting on a smile and setting your sights on your next task. It’s been nearly 5 years since the dizzies started, but today was the first time I’ve directly reckoned with the fact that it hurts to hear about other people making plans and doing things that I can’t. And that it probably will for many years to come. I hope that someday I’ll have accepted my new reality enough that it won’t hurt anymore, but that’s a white whale if I’ve ever seen one. But just as Captain Ahab never would have had a white whale to chase had he never set sail, we can’t accept a new reality without first facing what exactly that reality is. I think I’ll leave it at that for today, before I get any more ideas for questionable metaphors! </p>
								<p>Sporadically yours, </p>
