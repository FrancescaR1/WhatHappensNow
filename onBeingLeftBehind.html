								<p>Hi Friend,</p>
								<p align="justify"> More and more, these last few years, I’ve been feeling like the world is moving on without me. It’s as if I stopped dead in my tracks when I got sick but the world just kept on spinning. I’ll say, for the record, that I’m not a big fan of this whole pandemic situation, but in some twisted way, the fact that it slowed the world way down has felt so comfortable to me. Friend, I’ve always been the queen of the silver linings but I'll admit that even for me this, is taking it to the next level! Just leave it to me to find comfort in the pace of life created by a litteral worldwide disaster …  </p>
								<p align="justify"> I’ve lived my life in the fast lane for as long as I can remember, and I *love* it. When I’m feeling good, physically and mentally, I thrive when I have a hectic schedule. I love being involved in everything under the sun, new projects put wind in my sails and not to brag or anything, but fitting 16 different activities into a single afternoon is pretty much my superpower. Sure, it can be exhausting but to me it’s a good kind of exhausting. The kind that puts you right to sleep that night but leaves you refreshed and replenished the next day. But nowadays, I can’t do that anymore - at least not for very long. Most of the time, just living my everyday life is beyond exhausting and it’s all I can do to drag myself out of bed in the morning and do all the normal life things one needs to do to stay alive and functional. And that’s the thing with the fatigue that often comes hand in hand with chronic illness - you can’t just push through it. You have less spoons than you used to and they get used up fast <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. You just need to accept that when you’re out of spoons, you’re just out of spoons and short of having received a letter delivered by owl on your 11th birthday, you can’t just conjure more out of thin air.</p>
								<p align="justify"> I’ve been trying to accept all of that, but it’s hard. I know that taking time off during the time I have off from school and cutting down on my activities is the right thing to do. I know that taking a reduced course load and  being a part time student, that not accomplishing as much as my peers and that taking forever to finish my degree shouldn’t be a source of shame for me. And yet every time that someone asks me when I plan to graduate, why it’s taking me so long to finish my degree, what I’ve been up to this summer (nothing) or what my plans for the future are (truth is that past dinner tomorrow I’ve got nothing), I still feel shameful and inadequate. Every time I’ve decided to lengthen my degree, take some time off or chosen to not be involved in something I care about, it has felt like losing another piece of myself. I don’t know who I am when I’m stripped of my fast lane life, and I don’t like how the slow lane feels.  </p>
								<p align="justify"> So here I am, guiltily enjoying the fact that the world has been forced to merge into my lane. For so long, I’ve been longing for a pause button on life and this almost feels like I got it. Gives a whole new meaning to be careful what you wish for, now doesn’t it?  </p>

								<p>Sporadically yours, </p>
								<p>-E</p>
								
								<p id="footnote-1">[1] I am, of course, borrowing the spoon metaphor here and if you’re not familiar with the Spoon Theory, I highly recommend looking it up.</p>
